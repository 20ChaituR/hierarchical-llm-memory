# Hierarchical LLM Memory

Allows an LLM to explore your filesystem and read code files. The memory system is hierarchical, so even long code files are perfectly fine (as long as they're indented well).

## Setup

Install the requirements, and add your OpenAI API key.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```
